/**
 * A Jawk Extension.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this interface are eligible for insertion
 * into Jawk as an extension to the language. Extensions
 * appear within a Jawk script as function calls.
 *
 * <p>
 * Extensions introduce native Java modules into the Jawk language.
 * This enables special services into Jawk, such as Sockets,
 * GUIs, databases, etc. natively into Jawk.
 *
 * <p>
 * Extension functions can be used anywhere an AWK function,
 * builtin or user-defined, can be used. One immediate consideration
 * is the default Jawk input mechanism, where if action rules exist
 * (other than BEGIN/END), Jawk requires input from stdin before
 * processing these rules. It may be desirable to trigger action
 * rules on an extension rather than stdin user input. To prohibit
 * Jawk default behavior, a new command-line argument, "-ni" for
 * "no input", disables Jawk default behavior of consuming input
 * from stdin for action rules.
 * <blockquote>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> By disabling Jawk's default behavior of
 * consuming input from stdin, it can cause your script to loop
 * through all of the action rule conditions repeatedly, consuming
 * CPU without bounds. To guard against this, the extension should
 * provide some sort of poll or block call to avoid
 * out-of-control CPU resource consumption.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * Extensions introduce keywords into the Jawk parser.
 * Keywords are of type _EXTENSION_ tokens. As a result,
 * extension keywords cannot collide with other Jawk keywords,
 * variables, or function names. The extension mechanism
 * also guards against keyword collision with other extensions.
 * The Jawk lexer expects extension keywords to match as _ID_'s.
